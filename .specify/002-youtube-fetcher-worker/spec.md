## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**Operator**: Registers YouTube channels for monitoring, views health dashboards, and manages channel priorities to ensure continuous data collection from 200-1000 channels without exceeding API quotas.

**Data Consumer**: Queries historical and current YouTube channel statistics, video metadata, and performance trends for analytics and reporting purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new YouTube channel ID, **When** operator registers it, **Then** system automatically backfills all historical videos and begins daily stat collection
2. **Given** registered channels, **When** new videos are published, **Then** system discovers them within 10 minutes and hydrates metadata on first processing cycle
3. **Given** active channels, **When** daily refresh runs, **Then** channel stats are captured and hot videos (≤7 days old) receive priority refresh
4. **Given** API quota limits, **When** system processes batches, **Then** quota is never exceeded and processing continues at sustainable rate
5. **Given** system failures or retries, **When** jobs are re-executed, **Then** no duplicate data is created and stats history remains continuous

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a video becomes private or deleted after initial ingestion?
- How does system handle channels with hidden subscriber counts or region-restricted content?
- What occurs when RSS feeds are stale, missing, or temporarily unavailable?
- How are live streams with rapidly changing statistics managed?
- What happens with very large channels containing 50,000+ videos?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Channel Management
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept YouTube channel IDs for registration and begin automated data collection
- **FR-002**: System MUST perform initial backfill of channel's complete upload history upon registration
- **FR-003**: Operators MUST be able to pause, resume, and prioritize individual channels
- **FR-004**: System MUST monitor channel health and report processing status to operators

#### Data Collection & Refresh
- **FR-005**: System MUST capture daily snapshots of channel statistics (subscriber count, view count, video count)
- **FR-006**: System MUST refresh hot videos (published ≤7 days ago) more frequently than older content
- **FR-007**: System MUST rotate long-tail video refreshes over configurable time periods (days/weeks)
- **FR-008**: System MUST discover new video uploads within 10 minutes using RSS polling
- **FR-009**: System MUST batch API requests efficiently (≤50 channel IDs, ≤50 video IDs per request)

#### Queue Management & Reliability
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement smart queue with job priorities and per-channel serialization
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle retries with exponential backoff and jitter for failed operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST respect YouTube API quota limits and never exceed configured thresholds
- **FR-013**: System MUST perform idempotent data operations to prevent duplicates on retry
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain dead letter queues for permanently failed jobs

#### Data Integrity & Storage
- **FR-015**: System MUST store historical statistics with unique keys (video/channel ID + timestamp)
- **FR-016**: System MUST preserve complete daily statistics history for trend analysis
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle partial data scenarios (private videos, hidden metrics, deleted content)
- **FR-018**: Data consumers MUST be able to query channels, videos, and statistics through read-only interfaces

#### Observability & Monitoring
- **FR-019**: System MUST log all job events with structured data for debugging and monitoring
- **FR-020**: System MUST track and report quota usage, success rates, and processing metrics
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide visibility into queue depth, job status, and system health
- **FR-022**: System MUST alert operators when jobs consistently fail or quotas approach limits

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST support 200-1000 active channels concurrently
- **NFR-002**: System MUST maintain >90% uptime for data collection operations
- **NFR-003**: System MUST process new video discoveries within 10 minutes of RSS publication
- **NFR-004**: System MUST gracefully handle API rate limits, service outages, and partial failures
- **NFR-005**: System MUST maintain data consistency during concurrent operations and retries

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Channel**: Represents a YouTube channel with metadata (ID, title, description, subscriber count, etc.)
- **Video**: Represents individual videos with metadata (ID, title, duration, view count, like count, etc.)
- **Channel Stats**: Time-series data capturing daily channel metrics (subscribers, views, video count)
- **Video Stats**: Time-series data capturing video performance metrics (views, likes, comments)
- **Job**: Represents queued work items with priorities, retry counts, and execution status
- **Quota Usage**: Tracks API quota consumption and remaining limits per time period
