# Research: YouTube Fetcher Worker Implementation

## Technical Decisions

### Decision: Nuxt 3 + Supabase Architecture
**Rationale**: Nuxt 3 provides excellent TypeScript support and server-side API routes, while Supabase offers Postgres + Edge Functions + pg_cron in a managed platform. This combination reduces infrastructure complexity while maintaining scalability.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Pure Node.js + Express + separate Postgres hosting
- Next.js + separate background job processing
- Serverless functions with external queue systems

### Decision: Edge Functions for Workers
**Rationale**: Supabase Edge Functions run on Deno with excellent TypeScript support and can access the database with service role privileges. They auto-scale and have built-in monitoring.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Long-running Node.js workers
- AWS Lambda with SQS
- Background jobs in Nuxt server

### Decision: pg_cron for Scheduling
**Rationale**: pg_cron provides reliable, database-native scheduling that integrates seamlessly with our job queue. No external scheduler dependencies or coordination issues.

**Alternatives considered**:
- External cron with job enqueueing
- Node-cron in long-running processes
- Cloud scheduler services

### Decision: Advisory Locks + SKIP LOCKED for Queue
**Rationale**: Provides efficient, concurrent job processing with per-channel serialization. Native Postgres feature with excellent performance characteristics.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redis-based queues
- External message queues (RabbitMQ, etc.)
- Simple polling without locks

### Decision: API Key Authentication for Management API
**Rationale**: Simple, secure authentication for backend-to-backend communication. No user session management complexity while maintaining security.

**Alternatives considered**:
- JWT-based authentication
- Supabase Auth for user sessions
- OAuth2 client credentials

## YouTube API Integration Patterns

### Quota Management Strategy
- Token bucket algorithm with configurable refill rate
- Batch requests to maximize efficiency (50 IDs per request)
- Intelligent scheduling based on channel activity patterns
- Graceful degradation when approaching quota limits

### Error Handling Patterns
- Exponential backoff with jitter for 429/5xx errors
- Immediate failure for 4xx client errors (except 429)
- ETag/If-None-Match support for bandwidth optimization
- Circuit breaker pattern for sustained API failures

### Data Consistency Approach
- Idempotent upserts with unique constraint handling
- Timestamp-based versioning for historical data
- Atomic transactions for related data updates
- Conflict resolution for concurrent updates

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Selective indexes on frequently queried columns
- Partitioning for time-series data (daily stats)
- Connection pooling and query optimization
- Read replicas for analytics queries

### Edge Function Optimization
- Cold start mitigation through keep-alive scheduling
- Batch processing to amortize startup costs
- Efficient memory usage patterns
- Connection reuse for database operations

### Caching Strategy
- ETag-based HTTP caching for unchanged resources
- Database query result caching for expensive operations
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed configuration
- CDN caching for public API responses

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant data isolation
- Service role access limited to Edge Functions
- API key rotation and management procedures
- Least privilege principle for all database operations

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure secret management through Supabase
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Compliance
- Data retention policies aligned with YouTube ToS
- Privacy-preserving data collection practices
- Audit logging for all data modifications
- GDPR-compliant data handling procedures

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Strategy
- Queue depth and processing latency tracking
- API quota usage and rate limit monitoring
- Error rate and retry pattern analysis
- Database performance and connection monitoring

### Logging Strategy
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Centralized log aggregation and analysis
- Error alerting and escalation procedures
- Performance baseline establishment

### Health Checks
- Endpoint availability monitoring
- Database connectivity verification
- External API dependency health
- Job processing pipeline status

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Impact Risks
1. **YouTube API quota exhaustion**: Mitigated by intelligent batching and token bucket
2. **Large channel processing**: Handled by pagination limits and time-boxed processing
3. **RSS feed reliability**: Fallback to API-based discovery methods
4. **Cold start latency**: Addressed by coalescing and keep-alive patterns

### Medium-Impact Risks
1. **Database connection limits**: Managed by connection pooling and efficient queries
2. **Edge Function timeouts**: Handled by job chunking and progress checkpointing
3. **Data inconsistency**: Prevented by idempotent operations and transactions
4. **API key compromise**: Mitigated by rotation procedures and monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
- Mock all external API calls for isolation
- Test idempotent operations with duplicate scenarios
- Validate quota management and rate limiting logic
- Ensure type safety across all interfaces

### Integration Testing Approach
- Use test database instances for realistic scenarios
- Mock YouTube API with various response patterns
- Test concurrent processing and locking mechanisms
- Validate end-to-end job processing workflows

### Performance Testing Approach
- Load testing with 1000 channel simulation
- Stress testing for quota limit scenarios
- Latency testing for critical path operations
- Memory usage profiling for Edge Functions

## Technology Research Summary

All technical decisions have been validated through proof-of-concept implementations and align with the project's constitutional requirements for TypeScript strictness, test-driven development, and comprehensive observability.
