- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**Operator**: Registers YouTube channels for monitoring, views health dashboards, and manages channel priorities to ensure continuous data collection from 200-1000 channels without exceeding API quotas.

**Data Consumer**: Queries historical and current YouTube channel statistics, video metadata, and performance trends for analytics and reporting purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new YouTube channel ID, **When** operator registers it, **Then** system automatically backfills all historical videos and begins daily stat collection
2. **Given** registered channels, **When** new videos are published, **Then** system discovers them within 10 minutes and hydrates metadata on first processing cycle
3. **Given** active channels, **When** daily refresh runs, **Then** channel stats are captured and hot videos (≤7 days old) receive priority refresh
4. **Given** API quota limits, **When** system processes batches, **Then** quota is never exceeded and processing continues at sustainable rate
5. **Given** system failures or retries, **When** jobs are re-executed, **Then** no duplicate data is created and stats history remains continuous

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a video becomes private or deleted after initial ingestion?
- How does system handle channels with hidden subscriber counts or region-restricted content?
- What occurs when RSS feeds are stale, missing, or temporarily unavailable?
- How are live streams with rapidly changing statistics managed?
- What happens with very large channels containing 50,000+ videos?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Channel Management

- **FR-022**: System MUST alert operators when jobs consistently fail or quotas approach limits

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST support 200-1000 active channels concurrently
- **NFR-002**: System MUST maintain >90% uptime for data collection operations
- **NFR-003**: System MUST process new video discoveries within 10 minutes of RSS publication
- **NFR-004**: System MUST gracefully handle API rate limits, service outages, and partial failures
- **NFR-005**: System MUST maintain data consistency during concurrent operations and retries

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Channel**: Represents a YouTube channel with metadata (ID, title, description, subscriber count, etc.)
- **Video**: Represents individual videos with metadata (ID, title, duration, view count, like count, etc.)
- **Channel Stats**: Time-series data capturing daily channel metrics (subscribers, views, video count)
- **Video Stats**: Time-series data capturing video performance metrics (views, likes, comments)
- **Job**: Represents queued work items with priorities, retry counts, and execution status
- **Quota Usage**: Tracks API quota consumption and remaining limits per time period

## Public-facing App (discovery & UI spec)

This project also includes a public-facing, unauthenticated web application that exposes discovery and browsing features inspired by high-engagement platforms (e.g., YouTube, Netflix) while avoiding any UI or content infringement. The goal is a beautiful, modern site focused on discovery: new videos, trending videos, top channels, and curated lists. The app should be responsive, performant, accessible, and support light and dark themes with a user-selectable header control.

### Primary User Stories (public users)
- As an unauthenticated visitor I want to discover new videos so I can find interesting content quickly.
- As an unauthenticated visitor I want to browse trending videos so I can see whats popular now.
- As an unauthenticated visitor I want to view top channels and top videos across categories so I can explore creators and highly-rated content.
- As an unauthenticated visitor I want a fast, visually-rich experience with animations and theme options so the product feels polished and inviting.

### Functional Requirements (Public App)
- **PFA-001**: The app MUST expose a landing discovery page showing a mix of "New", "Trending", and "Top" cards in sections.
- **PFA-002**: The app MUST provide filters and tabbed sections for categories (e.g., Music, Gaming, News, Education) and allow sorting by recency, popularity, and engagement.
- **PFA-003**: The app MUST provide a detail modal or page for each video that shows metadata (title, short description, channel name, published date, basic stats) but must not embed or stream copyrighted content directly — instead link to the source when appropriate and allowed.
- **PFA-004**: The app MUST surface "Top Channels" with channel cards (name, avatar, short bio, aggregated stats) and provide paginated browsing and basic search.
- **PFA-005**: The app MUST implement infinite scroll or paginated feeds to load more results without full page refreshes.
- **PFA-006**: The app MUST be fully client-side rendered or hybrid SSR/CSR depending on SEO needs; server-side rendering is encouraged for the landing page and open graph meta when appropriate.
- **PFA-007**: The app MUST implement rate-limited client API calls and graceful fallback UIs when data is unavailable.

### UX & Visual Design Guidance
- Visual style should be modern and minimal, leveraging Tailwind utility classes and subtle animations (transitions on hover, card entrance animations, skeleton loaders while fetching).
- Use a card-first layout for discovery rows: responsive grid with 1-4 columns depending on viewport (mobile: 1, tablet: 2, desktop: 3-4).
- Provide accessible interactions (keyboard focus states, adequate color contrast, aria labels) and ensure animations can be reduced for prefers-reduced-motion.
- Header must contain a theme toggle (sun/moon icon), a compact search input, and a minimal brand mark. Theme selector should persist choice in localStorage and respect system preference by default.
- Provide a small "preview" overlay on hover/focus for video cards that shows a short excerpt (text) and primary actions (save, share, open source). Avoid autoplaying copyrighted media.

### Tailwind Implementation Notes
- Use Tailwind's dark mode class strategy (class-based) to toggle themes via a top-level `class="dark"` on the html/body wrapper.
- Example utilities to use: rounded-xl, shadow-lg, bg-surface/ bg-surface-dark, text-muted, transition-transform, transform hover:-translate-y-1, animate-fade-in, ring-2 ring-offset-2 focus:ring-primary.
- Implement a CSS variables theme layer for key colors to make theme tuning easier (use Tailwind config and CSS custom properties).

### Accessibility & Performance
- Ensure pages pass core web vitals thresholds: LCP < 2.5s, TTFB as low as possible for SSR pages, CLS minimal (reserve image/card space), FID/INP responsive.
- All interactive elements must be reachable via keyboard and announced by screen readers.

### Data & API Requirements (Public App)
- The backend MUST provide read-only endpoints for: discovery feed (with section flags), trending calculation, top channels, top videos, category lists, and video/channel metadata.
- Endpoints MUST support pagination, filtering, and sorting, and return lightweight payloads for initial lists with links for detail expansion.
- The app MUST avoid storing or exposing any API keys or secrets client-side.

### Acceptance Criteria (Public App)
- Given a fresh visitor, when they open the landing page, then they see at least three discovery sections (New, Trending, Top) with responsive cards and skeleton loading while data is fetched.
- Given a video card, when the user clicks, then a detail modal or page opens showing metadata and links but not streaming copyrighted content inline.
- Given the theme toggle, when the user switches theme, then the UI updates immediately and the choice persists on reload.
- Given slow or failing backend responses, when the client fetches data, then it shows skeletons and a friendly retry/backoff UI rather than a crash.

### Non-Functional & Privacy Considerations
- Do not collect personal data for unauthenticated visitors other than an optional anonymous cookie for theme preference and UX personalization. Document what is stored and for how long.
- Follow robots/meta guidance for discovery pages that should be indexed vs not indexed and provide server-rendered metadata for essential pages.
